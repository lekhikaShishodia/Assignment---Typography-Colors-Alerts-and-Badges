            Cheetahs in India: Eight <span class="bg-white"> Namibian wild cheetahs,</span> five females and three males, have been brought to India..</p>
        <p>
            <span class="bg-white">Over 70 years</span> after they went extinct, eight cheetahs landed in India on Saturday (September 17) from
            Namibia. The big cats were flown in on a modified passenger B-747 Jumbo Jet, which took off from Hosea
            Kutako International Airport in Windhoek and landed in <span class="bg-white">Madhya Pradesh’s Gwalior.</span> The cheetahs will be
            released by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on the occasion of his birthday today, at <span class="bg-white">Kuno National Park.</span></p>
        <p>
            On board the jet were eight Namibian wild cheetahs, <span class="bg-white">five females and three males.</span></p>
        <p>
            A plan to reintroduce cheetahs in India that was endorsed in 2009 by then Environment Minister <span class="bg-white">Jairam Ramesh</span>
            was shot down by the <span class="bg-white">Supreme Court</span> in 2013. The idea was revived in 2017 by the Narendra Modi government,
            and the SC cleared the move in 2020 “on an experimental basis”.
